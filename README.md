GISCUP 2015 - Routing with Polygonal Constraints Source Code

This year, I decided to enter the SIGSPATIAL GISCup challenge. The topic was very interesting: Find the shortest path in a street network given a set of dynamic, polygonal constraints. Furthermore, the challenge was very appealing as it started to be based on OpenStreetMap data without  much post-processing, so algorithms and demonstrations would be applicable to the whole world map (or sensible sections of the world map).

This is the source code, slightly cleaned up. It compiles on most systems using GNU C compiler and can serve as a reference or starting point when implementing graph search algorithms.

See the webpage for this project for further information including a video demonstration, a paper, a poster, and more...
